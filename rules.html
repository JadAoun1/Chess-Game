        <h2>Introduction to Chess</h2>
        <p>Chess is a two-player strategy game played on an 8x8 checkered board. The goal is to checkmate your opponent's king, which means placing it in a position where it cannot escape capture.</p>

        <h2>Setting Up the Board</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>The board should be positioned with a light-colored square in the bottom-right corner.</li>
          <li>Each player has 16 pieces: 1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, and 8 Pawns.</li>
          <li>Place the pieces as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>Rooks on the corners.</li>
              <li>Knights next to the Rooks.</li>
              <li>Bishops next to the Knights.</li>
              <li>Queens on their color (white queen on white square, black queen on black square).</li>
              <li>Kings go on the remaining squares.</li>
              <li>Pawns are placed in a row in front of the major pieces.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How the Pieces Move</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pawn:</strong> Moves forward one square but captures diagonally. On its first move, it can move forward two squares.</li>
          <li><strong>Rook:</strong> Moves any number of squares vertically or horizontally.</li>
          <li><strong>Knight:</strong> Moves in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular. Can jump over other pieces.</li>
          <li><strong>Bishop:</strong> Moves any number of squares diagonally.</li>
          <li><strong>Queen:</strong> Combines the power of the Rook and Bishop, moving any number of squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.</li>
          <li><strong>King:</strong> Moves one square in any direction. The King cannot move into check.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Special Rules</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Castling:</strong> A move involving the King and a Rook. The King moves two squares toward the Rook, and the Rook moves to the other side of the King. Conditions:
            <ul>
              <li>Neither the King nor the Rook has moved previously.</li>
              <li>No pieces are between the King and the Rook.</li>
              <li>The King is not in check, nor does it pass through or land in a square under attack.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>En Passant:</strong> A special pawn capture. If a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside an opponent's pawn, the opponent can capture it "in passing" as if it had only moved one square.</li>
          <li><strong>Promotion:</strong> When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it can be promoted to any piece (except a King), typically a Queen.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Check:</strong> The King is under attack and must be protected on the next move.</li>
          <li><strong>Checkmate:</strong> The King is in check and has no legal moves to escape.</li>
          <li><strong>Draw:</strong> The game ends in a tie if:
            <ul>
              <li>Stalemate: A player has no legal moves, but their King is not in check.</li>
              <li>Insufficient material: Neither player has enough pieces to deliver checkmate (e.g., King vs. King).</li>
              <li>Threefold repetition: The same position occurs three times.</li>
              <li>50-move rule: No pawn movement or capture has occurred in the last 50 moves.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips for Beginners</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Control the center of the board with pawns and pieces.</li>
          <li>Develop your pieces early and avoid moving the same piece multiple times in the opening.</li>
          <li>Keep your King safe by castling early.</li>
          <li>Think ahead and anticipate your opponent's moves.</li>
